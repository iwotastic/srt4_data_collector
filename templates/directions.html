    <h1>Directions</h1>
    <p class="lead">
      Hello {{ name }} and welcome to my SRT IV project! Please read the following directions carefully.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>When you click "Next" below you will be shown a random set of {{ num_forms_to_show }} forms.</li>
      <li>Some of the forms may look like "Sign In" forms, you don't actually have an account so just make something up for your password.</li>
      <li>Some of the forms may look like "Sign Up" forms, you aren't really making an account so just make something up for your password (you will not need to remember it).</li>
      <li>For any other text box that you are unsure of, just make something up. Just don't copy and paste something into the text boxes, you must type in them yourself.</li>
      <li>Text or passwords from these forms will never leave your computer, so you don't have to worry about anything being logged.</li>
    </ul>

    <button id="next" class="btn btn-success">Next</button>
